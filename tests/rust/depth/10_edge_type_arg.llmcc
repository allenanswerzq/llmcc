===============================================================================
Test that type_arg edges create correct dependency direction.
When generic G<T> uses type argument T, G's crate depends on T's crate.
At crate level: crate_app -> crate_types (app depends on types)

pub struct Item {

[dependencies]

use types::Item;

/// Container uses Item as type argument in Vec
pub struct Container {
    pub items: Vec<Item>,
