If you're working in a terminal or command prompt, you can typically use:\n\n- `exit` to close the current shell session\n- `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the current process\n- `Ctrl+D` to send EOF and exit many programs\n\nIf you're in Visual Studio Code, you can:\n- Close the integrated terminal with `Ctrl+` ` (backtick)\n- Close the editor with `Ctrl+W`\n- Exit VS Code entirely with `Ctrl+Shift+W` or `Alt+F4`\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like help with before you go?",
